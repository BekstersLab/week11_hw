                <p>This is a simple website written in Python with the Flask micro web framework.</p>
                <p>It has built upon last week's homework. Changes and improvements to the code include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Splitting the single app file into separate files using Jinja templates to remove duplicated HTML code</li>
                    <li>Implementing Bootstrap 5</li>
                    <li>Creating a contact form that stores a user's first name, last name, email and message in a database</li>
                    <li>Changing the home page welcome message based on the time of day using the datetime module to determine the current time and an if statement to update the message based on the hour</li>
                    <li>Linking to Google Fonts to incorporate open-source fonts to improve the website's typography</li>
                    <li>Creating a dynamic portfolio page that goes to database to source the content and links.</li>
                </ul>
